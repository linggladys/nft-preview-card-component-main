## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Basic flexbox
- Basic CSS Grid
- Constant Googling
- My hands

### What I learned

This more of a level-up version of the 1st challenge (the QR code). My output isn't exactly like the designs provided from this challenge.

### Continued development

It is pretty challenging to code for the colour overlay to occur as users hover over. There's still more space to learn and sharpen my CSS skills.

### Useful resources

- [Reset CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This is a good resource on customising reset CSS.
- [Overlay CSS when hover](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This is where I (kinda) have the inspiration from.
